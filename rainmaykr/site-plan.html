      <h3>Software Development</h3>
      <p>
        The use of <a id="trying_out_jump_link">software solutions</a> in a business can provide many benefits. Software 
        solutions can help streamline and automate processes, making them more efficient and 
        less time consuming. They can also provide insights into customer trends and behaviors, 
        allowing businesses to gain a better understanding of their target audience.
        Additionally, they can enable businesses to easily manage customer data, create marketing 
        campaigns, and measure performance. Furthermore, software solutions often come with 
        built-in security measures that protect businesses from outside threats.</p>

        <p> There is a need to ensure that the functionalities are integrated into your business 
        process to maximize the benefits, so there are no such thing like “some transactions are 
        not recorded using the system”. The business owner need to make sure that all kinds of 
        business quirks and transaction characteristics are addressed in the software they are buying.</p>

        <p> You may want all that fancy graphs and presentation notes on your next shareholders meeting 
        or analyst briefing, but without proper and consistent data inputs from the guys on the ground, 
        the expensive system will be useless.</p> 

        <p>At the RainMaykr Soft-solutions, particularly interested in “tech” startups because they often err
          in focusing too much on their “tech” products, not on how they run their business. When they grow to certain scale, their 
          internal process inefficiencies caught up with them and prevented them from profiting nor 
          slimming down on personnel cost due to manual integration / reconciliation workload.</p>
